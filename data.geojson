experimental artists engaged in new art practices.” The gallery engages in dialogue with its audience on three fronts. Firstly, it showcases art that explores current issues and themes. Secondly, the gallery ensures the accessibility of its art by giving the artists a venue “free of commercial restrictions and censorship” and offering “extended programming such as artist lectures, panel discussions, exhibition catalogs, workshops, or performances” with each of its exhibitions. Finally, the gallery seeks to educate younger artists about art and current art issues through its NEXUSselects program. During the summer, the gallery runs the Summer Community Arts Series, in which it provides “professional gallery space to community art organizations, which in turn brings focus to their mission, adds value to their program and enriches the experience of their participants.” Nexus Art Gallery chooses its members through a peer-review selection process. In exchange for fees, meeting attendance, and gallery staffing and work, members receive, among other benefits, access to both solo and group exhibitions, access to funding, and the ability to cooperate with similar galleries.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2116,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.140503,39.973251]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"health","h2":"","h3":"Chiropractic","org":"Kim

strong academic and social skills, intense personal interests, a love for the arts, and a commitment to building inclusive and peaceful communities.” The elected, 20-member Board of Directors, comprised of teachers, current parents, and alumni parents, oversees the school’s general operations and has four primary responsibilities: “it selects, evaluates, and supports the Principal of the School, to whom it delegates authority to manage the School; it develops broad institutional policies that guide the Principal in running the School; it plans and provides oversight of the annual operating budget, oversees the School's endowments, sponsors development activities, and maintains the financial well-being of the School; and it nurtures a sense of community-wide involvement and support of the School.” Miquon prides itself in progressive education, which rests on core values such as active learning, strong community and social justice and democracy.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2133,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.268669,40.065941]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"food

their talents and interests to “help enrich the learning experience for both adults and children.” In addition, says its brochure, parent co-oping both helps keep the child to adult ratio at a low 5:1

To believe in themselves, children need to feel that the adults around them believe in them as separate individuals with the right to form their own opinions, express their own desires, and to make their own mistakes.” As a parent cooperative, Charlestown Playhouse works to create an environment in which “teachers, parents, and children can learn and grow together. In keeping with the spirit of Playschool, parents cooperate both in attending to the physical requirements of the school and in participating in the learning experiences of the children by helping in the classroom.” Charlestown finds four primary benefits of parent cooperatives: they keep tuitions low, they create a low child-to-adult ratio, they allow parents to incorporate insights learned in the classroom to their own homes, and they foster a strong sense of values and communities.","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2131,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.556236,40.10347]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"finance","h2":"Credit

Amistad serves to “ make improvements in the park, sustain a community garden, create activities for local children, address neighborhood needs and crises, and build a supportive community.” It is a

It is run by a Board of Directors, primarily composed of parents. Parent cooperation is necessary for the success of TCDN, and parents are invited to sit in on board meetings and assist in fundraising events. “The cooperative nature of TCDN is manifest in the spirit that guides the interchange between those of us involved with the organization, a spirit of willingness, openness and of caring. This is evident in the receptivity of staff to the needs of parents, an attitude that enables parents to feel they have an appreciation for and active role in their child’s day. It is mirrored in the sensitivity on the part of parents to the needs of each site. To continue the spirit of “family groupings” TCDN runs according to a mixed-age educational model.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2134,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.349998,39.906383]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"food

individual exhibitions. “To this end","field_15":"” says its mission statement, “we have developed comprehensive exhibition schedule including solo show of both member and guest artists, a curated

Each resident is expected to both attend monthly meetings and join at least one committee, such as the Activities, Community Building, or Finance Committee. Tanguy strives to establish a sense of community by implementing workdays, welcoming a diverse group of people, and hosting community “celebrations, holidays, ball games, fishing contests, singing, dances, and potlucks.” Each member family owns a 2-acre house and is granted access to the “community center, ball field, pond, and woods.” New members must pay a $500 fee, a sum that will be returned upon selling share to new member. In addition, members are required to pay a $50 fee to help maintain the facility.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2161,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.511093,39.944172]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"food & farming","h2":"grow local","h3":"Compost","org":"Fairmount Park Organic Recycling Center","url":" phila.gov/ParksandRecreation/environment/Pages/RecyclingCenter.aspx","addr":" 3850 Ford Rd","city_state_zip":" Phila PA","hood":"","county":"","phone":" 215.685.0108","fb":"","contact":"","email":"","_desc":" upto 30 gallons of compost or woodchips FREE to residents - Go with a car full of buckets and load up!

afford to pay the rising costs of child care. PIC believes that the early years of development are monumental not just for a child, but for the entire family. Thus, PIC’s “uniquely participatory approach involves parents in most phases of the center’s work – from volunteering in the classroom to serving on the board of directors.” PIC strives to exchange information, make dynamic decisions, and provide parenting support. Children, from ages six years to five months, both work alone and in groups, fostered by a low child-adult ratio (thanks to its mandatory parent volunteer days). PIC also works to build community in and out of the classroom, and approach problems with cooperation, not conflict.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2126,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.207176,39.952389]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"food

Says its website, “The child care field will only be improved when early educators take leadership in informing parents and the larger community of the importance of their work, and how crucial it is to adequately fund the education of young children and fairly compensate teachers.” In addition to providing the best possible care for children, Childspace CDI is also involved in a number of advocacy efforts to educate the community about the importance of a healthy childcare system. Child care providers are also encouraged to educate themselves about relevant policies, join committees to improve the level of care given, and organize and participate in events for parents and care workers to share information and experiences.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2124,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.17466,40.033352]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"green

As a parent cooperative, it strives to incorporate students’ parents into the educational experience as much as possible: “Just as parents determine the goals, focus and philosophy of the school, students – working with teachers and parents – shape their educational goals and decide specific topics of study they are interested in pursuing","field_15":"” its mission statement says. The structure of Project Learn sets itself apart from traditional educational systems in a number of ways. For one, many of its classes are “vertically grouped","field_16":"” in that they consist of students of all ages. In addition, Project Learn places a strong emphasis on Group Time, during which students are grouped and assigned to a project designed to foster a sense of leadership and cooperation in all involved. Project Learn believes in incorporating not just parents, teachers, and administrators in educational decisions, but students as well: “Since education is only meaningful when students are personally involved, we believe in giving students the opportunity to share in the planning and directing of their education. The school strives to provide a productive and creative learning environment that meets the intellectual, social, emotional, and physical needs of every student.” Finally, Project Learn works hard to build community, whether it is in the classroom, through activities such as Group Time, or in the Mt. Airy community, where students utilize local resources and perform community service.","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2127,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-75.18351,40.049179]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"clothing","h2":"","h3":"Thrift

together a distinctive group of parents and talented educators. It has been operating continuously since then as a non-profit, non-sectarian nursery school for children of families in nearby communities.” While the Educational Director, teachers, and teachers assistants are responsible for helming the pre-school’s curriculum, CCNS is completely owned and run by its parent membership. The Board of Officers and Trustees, comprised of twelve volunteer parents and the Educational Director, decide the school’s general operations (e.g. policy making and event planning). The school’s mission emphasizes the necessary commitment – service on either the Board or a committee, helping fundraise, and participating in a group “scrub-up” of toys, – from membership parents: “Once your child walks into our little red schoolhouse, you are making a conscious choice to become actively involved in his or her preschool education. This is what we refer to as the Cooperative Difference.” Members are asked to pay a $150 membership bond, which is refunded after “successful completion of your cooperative obligations.","field_15":"","field_16":"","field_17":"","field_18":"","field_19":"","field_20":"","field_21":"","field_22":"","field_23":"","field_24":"","cartodb_id":2132,"created_at":"2014-06-21T22:43:38Z","updated_at":"2014-06-21T22:44:48Z","cartodb_georef_status":true},"geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-74.870644,40.291023]}},{"type":"Feature","properties":{"h1":"food

Decisions are made at regular monthly meetings that are led by an elected group of leaders and run democratically and via consensus. Members of the cooperative are expected to contribute to the maintenance of the community, be it through committees, participation in work parties, or volunteer jobs. In return, members are welcome to a number of events throughout the year, and are granted access to “an organic community garden, a community swimming pool, tennis courts, a soccer field, and a community center.” The membership process is somewhat involved and extensive, “for Bryn Gweled is not just a place to live, but also a way of living. And along with the freedoms of ownership and self-governance comes a greater set of responsibilities on the part of the people who live here. All of our lives are intertwined in some way with one another.
